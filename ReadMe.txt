About the Projects:

Elite Command:
Elite Command was my nod to the map GunshipRPG that I had enjoyed as a child.
When the Remastered was announced I could think of no better way to commemorate
the game that sparked my initial interest in programming and game design.

The story borrows from elements of the original Gunship map that inspired it,
as well as elements of the Enslaver's campaign and a co-op campaign that I had 
made during my teens.  A top-secret Dominion research base has come under siege
after a previously-dormant Zerg brood that was once cannon fodder has awakened.
Help is far away, but an elite mercenary group is able to respond quickly... but 
all is not as it seems.  



Shipwrecked:
This was ironically never supposed to be what it is.  Shipwrecked originally started
because I wanted to experiment with class design concepts.  Piece by piece, new and 
existing spells found synergies in each other as various character archtypes began to 
conceptualize.  Natrually, these characters needed ground to stand on and monsters to
test their powerful spells on so land was dredged and fodder was placed.

The more the island began to materialize, the more my friends took interest.  Almost 
as if by accident Shipwrecked became a LAN party favorite.  Art assets, management 
systems, spells, and many, many tutorials from the community have also been adapted to 
the setting over the years.  It goes without saying that this idea wouldn't be what it 
is without the community.  Although this is still very much a work in progress I have 
every intention of finishing and polishing this concept after Graduation when Reforged
hits the market.  

Unity Projects:
These two projects are a small sampling of the learning projects I have done in Unity.
I love working with the engine, and hope to continue to practice my skills with the 
engine soon.
